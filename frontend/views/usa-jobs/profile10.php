                <ul class="list-2">
                    <li>Apply for competitive service jobs, within the United States, and agencies can hire you directly without having to compete with the public.</li>
                    <li>Apply to merit promotion jobs, if the job application states "open to family of overseas employees".</li>

                <p>If you’re moving overseas, because a family member has been assigned to an overseas duty of station, you may be eligible to apply for overseas jobs with the Federal Government. There are a couple of options available. </p>

                <p>Your eligibility does not entitle you to a job within the Federal Government. You must still apply and meet qualification standards and additional requirements, such as a background investigation. </p>
