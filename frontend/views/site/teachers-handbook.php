                                <p>Empower Youth Class model is based on subscription model. Here students will get a free trial period of 15 DAYS  after which they have to subscribe to EY classes membership and pay a monthly or annual membership fee. During the free trial the students will be allowed to view the video once but after paying the membership fee they can watch the video for multiple times for the period they have paid the fees.</p>
                                <p>We compensate teachers for actual time the student plays their video like if the video is of 10 minutes and students plays it at 2x speed then the compensation is made for 5 minutes. Also if student views the same video multiple times it will be counted as single view on the basis of which compensation will be made</p>

                                <p>In addition to the compensation made for the viewing of video ,
                                    Empower Youth will provide you additional Rs.500 for every student you will bring to
                                    the platform through your referral link.The amount will be credited once the student
                                    signs up and pays the subscription fees (which means amount will be credited if he pays the subscription fees
                                    after the free trial period).
                                    Your referral link can be found within the Promote section of your class(es)

                                <h3>Earning Royalties</h3>
                                <p>Empower Youth teachers earn revenue based on a royalty system. Each month, 30% of Empower Youth's total Membership revenue goes to a royalty pool for teachers.
                                    Teachers are paid from the royalty pool based on their share of the minutes watched by the students (only paying members) across the platform each month. For example, if a teacher's classes receive 5% of the minutes-watched by Paid members, that teacher receives 5% of the royalty pool. Because we are a subscription service, the size of the royalty pool and the number of minutes watched on Empower Youth fluctuates from month-to-month.</p>
                                <p>In Order to avoid duplicity or Spamming we will count one users view per course content only once a month. It will be resent again I.e if a person watched your video twice in one month then it will be counted only once but if he watches once in one month and then watched the same video in subsequent month it shall be counted once per month. Although we trust all of our teachers but still it is to avoid spamming if someone tries to do it.</p>
                                <p>To receive a payment for a month you must get a minimum total of 30 Premium minutes-watched across all of your classes within a month. Please note, minutes watched by students through a free class or through a free access link do not count towards royalty payments.</p>

                                <h4>Why class quality matters</h4>
                                <p>Teachers earn money when students watch their classes: the more minutes students
                                    watch; the more revenue teachers earn. It follows that the better your classes are,
                                    the more revenue you will see at the end of each month. This is one way that quality
                                    = success on Empower Youth.</p>
                                <p>High-quality classes are also eligible for special promotions or features, browse page features, or inclusion in our workshop
                                    programming, which help further raise visibility and credibility on the
                                    platform. </p>
                                <p class="text-italic">A high-quality class → a great student experience → more minutes
                                    watched → more followers and visibility → success! </p>
                                <p>Creating a high-quality class takes time and effort — it’s not quick and easy. But
                                    even beyond the success you find here, learning how to produce polished video
                                    content is valuable, not every teacher will be well-versed with technology but we’ll
                                    help you every step of the way!</p>

                                        <p>Introduction videos let the student know what they’re about to learn, and
                                            provide you with an opportunity to share your
                                            experience and background. Students need to understand why they should trust
                                            you. This is your chance to tell them!</p>

                                        <p>Great instruction requires great structure. Classes must be based upon a
                                            lesson plan or course outline.</p>

                                        <p>Your class should contain varied visuals throughout. For example, include
                                            on-screen text and example images,
                                            or switch between talking head shots and slides. Talking head shots need to
                                            be well-lit with professional
                                            backdrops. Slides need to be well-structured and visually-appealing. Avoid
                                            rambling, or excessive pauses.</p>

                                        <p>You should impart expertise through tips, best practices, frameworks,
                                            concepts, theory, and/or examples.

                                <p>Our students are always ready to learn from teachers who bring something new for them to learn.</p>
                                <p>So we recommend you to teach any topic that you feel you are passionate about.</p>

                                <p>Some tips we recommend you to keep in mind when you’re deciding what to teach:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Be specific</h4>
                                        <p> Specificity will help to differentiate your class from others on the platform. So, we suggest to keep your class focused on a specific subject that you know well .Along with specificity, keep your class short (we typically recommend between 20-60 minutes), focused, and manageable.  </p>

                                <h3>Choosing Your Class Project</h3>
                                <p>Since EmpowerYouth focuses on project-based learning so all classes must have project component. This is because we believe that project helps the students to give a practical touch to their new skill.</p>
                                <p>Tips for creating a class project more exciting for students:</p>
                                <h4>1. Project should be easy to start</h4>
                                <p>Students always prefer those projects which are quick and easy to do over time consuming and complicated projects. So, we recommend you to devise projects which are lightweight so that students can feel immediate sense of accomplishment without feeling any sort of burden.
                                </p>
                                <h4>2. Give clear-cut instructions</h4>
                                <p>When students are given clear instructions they are more willing to complete the task. So give the description of your project in such a manner that it encourages students to complete the project. If you want to provide any additional resource to help the students to complete the task feel free to attach such file.
                                </p>
                                <h4>3. Encourage students to share their work</h4>
                                <p>When students are encouraged to share their work it helps them in many ways. It helps to create better learning experience for other students. Also when the creator of the project gets feedback from others it helps in the overall growth and development of creator. So, we recommend to encourage your students to share their work-in-progress.

                                    the most important part of producing a great class is teaching with confidence.
                                    Having solid equipment is important, but ultimately the thing that matters most is you:
                                    the teacher.</p>
                                <p>Our most successful teachers are clear, confident, and relaxed in front of the camera.
                                    Don't be afraid to smile, speak casually, and show your personality! Students love seeing
                                    a teacher have fun — there's no need for your class to feel formal. As long as you follow
                                    our pedagogical and quality best practices there’s plenty of room for style.</p>
                                <p>Appearing comfortable may not come easily and that’s okay. Here are some tried and true tips
                                    and tricks for bringing a comfortable vibe to your class</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Use your hands as you would when talking to a friend. Think of it as a conversation rather than a lecture. </li>
                                    <li>Look directly into the camera as you would if you were speaking to a friend. Better yet, imagine you are speaking to someone specific that you know would enjoy learning what you have to teach. </li>
                                    <li>Speak clearly and naturally. Keep your pace moderate and allow your tone to go up and down. Don’t be afraid to show enthusiasm and excitement!</li>
                                    <li>Avoid distracting “ums” and “ahs.” These often sneak in inadvertently, so just do a quick retake if you notice them, or edit them out later. </li>
                                    <li>Continually refer back to your outline to ensure you’re sticking to talking points rather than rambling or getting off-track</li>
                                    <li>Don’t forget to smile! Smiling is one of the easiest and fastest ways to set a friendly, relaxed, and comfortable tone for your class. </li>
