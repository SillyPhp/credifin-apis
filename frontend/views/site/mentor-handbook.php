                                <p>Emower Youth Class model is based on subscription model. Here students will get a free trial period of 15 DAYS  after which they have to subscribe to EY classes membership and pay a monthly or annual membership fee. During the free trial the students will be allowed to view the video once but after paying the membership fee they can watch the video for multiple times for the period they have paid the fees.</p>
                                <p>We compensate teachers for actual time the student plays their video like if the video is of 10 minutes and students plays it at 2x speed then the compensation is made for 5 minutes. Also if student views the same video multiple times it will be counted as single view on the basis of which compensation will be made</p>

                                    signs up and pays the subscription fees (which means amount will be credited if he pays the subscription fees
                                    after the free trial period).

                                <p>Empower Youth teachers earn revenue based on a royalty system. Each month, 30% of Empower Youth's total Membership revenue goes to a royalty pool for teachers.
                                    Teachers are paid from the royalty pool based on their share of the minutes watched by the students (only paying members) across the platform each month. For example, if a teacher's classes receive 5% of the minutes-watched by Paid members, that teacher receives 5% of the royalty pool. Because we are a subscription service, the size of the royalty pool and the number of minutes watched on Empower Youth fluctuates from month-to-month.</p>
                                <p>On average, first-time teachers earn Rs.300 in their first month on EY, with top teachers earning upto. Rs 3,000.</p>
                                <p>To receive a payment for a month you must get a minimum total of 30 Premium minutes-watched across all of your classes within a month. Please note, minutes watched by students through a free class or through a free access link do not count towards royalty payments.</p>

                                <h4>Why class quality matters</h4>
                                <p>Teachers earn money when students watch their classes: the more minutes students
                                    watch; the more revenue teachers earn. It follows that the better your classes are,
                                    the more revenue you will see at the end of each month. This is one way that quality
                                    = success on Empower Youth.</p>
                                <p>High-quality classes are also eligible for special promotions or features, browse page features, or inclusion in our workshop
                                    programming, which help further raise visibility and credibility on the
                                    platform. </p>
                                <p class="text-italic">A high-quality class → a great student experience → more minutes
                                    watched → more followers and visibility → success! </p>
                                <p>Creating a high-quality class takes time and effort — it’s not quick and easy. But
                                    even beyond the success you find here, learning how to produce polished video
                                    content is valuable, not every teacher will be well-versed with technology but we’ll
                                    help you every step of the way!</p>

                                            experience and background. Students need to understand why they should trust

                                        <p>Great instruction requires great structure. Classes must be based upon a
                                            lesson plan or course outline.</p>

                                        <p>Your class should contain varied visuals throughout. For example, include

                                            or switch between talking head shots and slides. Talking head shots need to
                                            be well-lit with professional
                                            backdrops. Slides need to be well-structured and visually-appealing. Avoid
                                            rambling, or excessive pauses.</p>

You have to plan the topic of the class in such a manner that when you come up with it, the class turns to be fun and engaging projects. So, we advise you to get your thoughts organised and synchronise them in such a manner that the purpose of planning is fulfilled.
                                   We understand that the planning may take some time in the beginning but ultimately the whole process will go more smoothly and the production will be much easier.</p>

                                <p>Our students are always ready to learn from teachers who bring something new for them to learn.</p>
                                <p>So we recommend you to teach any topic that you feel you are passionate about.</p>
                                <p>You can choose from any trending topic to any abstract topic. We welcome all the topics at our platform which will help our students to learn and grow.</p>
                                <p>Some tips we recommend you to keep in mind when you’re deciding what to teach:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Be specific</h4>
                                       <p> Specificity will help to differentiate your class from others on the platform. So, we suggest to keep your class focused on a specific subject that you know well .Along with specificity, keep your class short (we typically recommend between 20-60 minutes), focused, and manageable.  </p>
                                    </li>

                                        <p>When you put yourself in situation same as that of students it will help you to choose a topic which is trending or what students wishes to learn. Ultimately you will find a topic which will help you to attract audience.</p>

                                        <p>When you are thinking about the topic, simultaneously give a thought about the project that you will give to your students. This approach will in understanding the practical aspects of the topic that you are planning to teach the students.</p>

                                <h3>Choosing Your Class Project</h3>
                                <p>Since EmpowerYouth focuses on project-based learning so all classes must have project component. This is because we believe that project helps the students to give a practical touch to their new skill.</p>
                                <p>Tips for creating a class project more exciting for students:</p>
                                <h4>1. Project should be easy to start</h4>
                                <p>Students always prefer those projects which are quick and easy to do over time consuming and complicated projects. So, we recommend you to devise projects which are lightweight so that students can feel immediate sense of accomplishment without feeling any sort of burden.
                                </p>
                                <h4>2. Give clear-cut instructions</h4>
                                <p>When students are given clear instructions they are more willing to complete the task. So give the description of your project in such a manner that it encourages students to complete the project. If you want to provide any additional resource to help the students to complete the task feel free to attach such file.
                                </p>
                                <h4>3. Encourage students to share their work</h4>
                                <p>When students are encouraged to share their work it helps them in many ways. It helps to create better learning experience for other students. Also when the creator of the project gets feedback from others it helps in the overall growth and development of creator. So, we recommend to encourage your students to share their work-in-progress.

                                    the most important part of producing a great class is teaching with confidence.
                                    Having solid equipment is important, but ultimately the thing that matters most is you:
                                    the teacher.</p>
                                <p>Our most successful teachers are clear, confident, and relaxed in front of the camera.
                                    Don't be afraid to smile, speak casually, and show your personality! Students love seeing

                                    <li>Use your hands as you would when talking to a friend. Think of it as a conversation rather than a lecture. </li>
                                    <li>Look directly into the camera as you would if you were speaking to a friend. Better yet, imagine you are speaking to someone specific that you know would enjoy learning what you have to teach. </li>
                                    <li>Speak clearly and naturally. Keep your pace moderate and allow your tone to go up and down. Don’t be afraid to show enthusiasm and excitement!</li>
                                    <li>Avoid distracting “ums” and “ahs.” These often sneak in inadvertently, so just do a quick retake if you notice them, or edit them out later. </li>
                                    <li>Continually refer back to your outline to ensure you’re sticking to talking points rather than rambling or getting off-track</li>
                                    <li>Don’t forget to smile! Smiling is one of the easiest and fastest ways to set a friendly, relaxed, and comfortable tone for your class. </li>
