                                <h3>How Earning Works</h3>
                                <p>Skillshare operates under a subscription model, which means that students pay a monthly or annual fee for a Premium Membership, which includes unlimited access to our entire catalog of Premium classes, and other Premium features like offline viewing through our mobile app.</p>
                                <p>We compensate teachers for every minute watched by Premium students in their classes and for every student they bring to Skillshare through their referral link. How does it work? </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Earn Premium Referrals: Get &#8377;10 for every student you bring to Skillshare that signs up for a Premium Membership. </li>
                                    <li>Earn Royalties: Earn royalties based on the number of minutes watched in your classes every month.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Our top teachers make over &#8377;1,00,000 a year! In this section, learn everything you need to start earning money teaching on Skillshare. </p>

                                <h3>Earning Premium Referrals</h3>
                                <p>As a teacher, you can earn a &#8377;10 referral bonus for each new Premium Member you bring to Skillshare. People who sign up through your referral won't be charged anything for their first two months. You'll receive your bonus when they sign up.</p>
                                <p>You can view your referral history on the Premium Referrals page within your Profile Settings. </p>
                               <p>Your referral link can be found within the Promote section of your class(es) as well as on the Premium Referrals page within your Profile Settings. </p>

                                <h3>Earning Royalties</h3>
                                <p>Skillshare teachers earn revenue based on a royalty system. Each month, 30% of Skillshare’s total Premium Membership revenue goes to a royalty pool for teachers. </p>
                                <p>Teachers are paid from the royalty pool based on their share of the minutes watched by Premium students (both paying members and those in free trials) across the platform each month. For example, if a teacher's classes receive 5% of the minutes-watched by Premium members, that teacher receives 5% of the royalty pool. Because we are a subscription service, the size of the royalty pool and the number of minutes watched on Skillshare fluctuates from month-to-month. </p>
                                <p>On average, first-time teachers earn &#8377;200 in their first month on Skillshare, with top teachers earning upwards of &#8377;3,000! </p>
                                <p>You must get a minimum total of 30 Premium minutes-watched across all of your classes within a month in order to receive a payment for that month. Please note, minutes watched by students through a free class or through a free access link do not count towards royalty payments. </p>

                                <h3>Earning FAQs</h3>
                                <h4>Will minutes watched offline through the app count?</h4>
                                <p>Yes, offline watch time is recorded and incorporated just like online watch time. Your class stats will update the next time a member logs in online.</p>
                                <h4>What if a student watches my class in 2X speed?</h4>
                                <p>The actual amount of time a student spends watching your videos is what will count towards your total minutes watched. For example, if a student watches your 10 minute video in 2X speed, this would count as 5 minutes watched. If a student watches your 10 minute video in 0.5X speed, this would count as 20 minutes watched.</p>
                                <h4>Does this mean that longer classes are better?</h4>
                                <p>No, because longer classes are often less engaging, they often receive fewer minutes watched than their shorter, more engaging counterparts. The most important thing is that your classes are actually watched, so making them truly compelling is the primary goal. </p>
                                <p>A shorter, high-quality class is more likely to get watched all the way through, receive positive reviews, and attract more students. To hit the student engagement sweet spot, keep your class between 20-60 minutes.</p>

                                <p>Welcome to the Skillshare Teacher Handbook! This resource is designed to help you translate your passion into an engaging, actionable, and high-quality Skillshare class.</p>
                                <p>Empower Youth teachers are everyday creators, entrepreneurs, and professionals — people like you! You don’t need to have experience teaching or be well known to publish your first class and grow a following. You’ve got this!</p>

                            <div class="tab-pane" id="startedTwo">
                                <h3>How Skillshare Classes Work</h3>
                                <p>Skillshare classes are authentic, actionable, and designed to help students bring what they learn into the real world. Focusing on in-demand creative and entrepreneurial skills, popular topics include: design, illustration, writing, photography, productivity, freelancing, and much more.</p>
                                <p>On Skillshare, students watch classes at their own pace, create projects to practice what they’ve learned, and interact with each other from all around the world. As a teacher, you get to facilitate this unique learning experience, and that all starts with understanding the 3 pillars of Skillshare’s pedagogy.  </p>
                                <h4>Focused and Digestible </h4>
                                <p>Skillshare classes, on average, include 20-60 minutes of pre-recorded video content broken down into a series of short 2-5 minute videos. Rather than teaching a broad, sweeping skill set, the most successful classes hone in on one specific project, concept, or skill. This succinct and digestible format allows for focused and engaged learning.</p>
                                <h4>Project-Based </h4>
                                <p>All classes on Skillshare include a fun project that helps students practice and share with the class community. Creating and sharing projects, and giving and receiving feedback, are the heart and soul of engaged learning. For many students, receiving peer and teacher feedback is their favorite part of Skillshare life. And for many teachers, seeing their students' work is one of the most rewarding parts of teaching. </p>
                                <h4>Personal, Honest, and Human </h4>
                                <p>Skillshare is different from other online communities. Here, open, personal, real connection makes everyone feel included and welcome, and makes sharing feel safe. We work hard to cultivate trust in our community and so do all of our teachers! It is reflected in everything we do: from our class guidelines to our brand identity. And it should be reflected in everything you do, too: from the classes you make to the way you communicate with your students. </p>
